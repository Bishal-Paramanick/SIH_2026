"""
neo4j_loader.py
Loads the real graph from Person 2's Neo4j instance into the same
networkx.MultiDiGraph everything else in this folder expects.

Matches Person 2's actual seed schema (2026-08-29):
  - Node labels ARE the entity type (e.g. `(:Person)`), NOT a "type"
    property -- Cypher `labels(n)[0]` gives us that string, and it already
    matches Person 4's official Title Case EntityType ("Person", "Phone",
    "Location", "Vehicle", "Organization") exactly. No normalization
    needed on this path (unlike json_loader.py, which has to handle an
    older all-caps convention).
  - Property names line up with Person 4's NodeProperties schema field
    for field: normalized_name, aliases, latitude/longitude,
    registration_number, vehicle_type, created_at/updated_at.
  - Relationship properties (source_doc, timestamp, duration, amount,
    transaction_id, role, confidence) also match EdgeProperties directly.

Connection settings default to a local Docker Neo4j instance -- override
via environment variables if Person 2's instance runs elsewhere.
